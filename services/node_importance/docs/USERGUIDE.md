## ClosenessCentrality

Compute closeness centrality for nodes.

### Inputs

* A graph (required)
* distance (Optional. Default is False): If True, then the weights in the given graph are used in shortest path calculations
* wf_improved (optional. Default value is 'wf_improved'. Any other value other than the default value including the null string will result in not using the [improved Wasserman and Faust formula](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.closeness_centrality.html#networkx.algorithms.centrality.closeness_centrality).
* reverse (Optional. Default is False): If True and input graph G is a directed graph, reverse the edges of G, using successors instead of predecessors.
* directed (Optional. Default is False). If True the graph is treated as a directed graph where the first specified node in an edge is the source node.

## BetweennessCentrality

Find the BetweennessCentrality of nodes.

### Inputs

* A graph (required)
* type (Optional. Possible values are 'node'(default) and 'edge'): Indicates to calculate node or edge betweeness centrality
* k (optional. Default value is zero meaning that the parameter is not used)
* normalized (Optional. Default is True): If k is not zero use k node samples to estimate betweenness. The value of k <= n where n is the number of nodes in the graph. Higher values give better approximation.
* weight (Optional. Default is False): If True, then the weights in the given graph are used
* endpoints (Optional. Default is False): If True include the endpoints in the shortest path counts.
* seed (Optional. Default is zero meaning that the parameter is not used): â€“ Indicator of random number generation state. This is only used if k is not None.
* directed (Optional. Default is False). If True the graph is treated as a directed graph where the first specified node in an edge is the source node.
